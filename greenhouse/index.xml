      <description>Let The Build Begin The date is the 5th of February 2022. It&amp;rsquo;s cold. Really cold. My friend Will offered to help with the build. We had 48 hours to do so before getting back to work in Oxford on the Monday! So please excuse the messy wiring, we really didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time or daylight!
Here are the panels and batteries
Will&amp;rsquo;s window cleaning services.
2x4 wooden frame to keep the panels off the ground as my dads one and only rule for having the panels was that he could mow the grass with ease.</description>

      <description>Introduction Back in 2013 I&amp;rsquo;d have just completed my 3rd year at university and was pretty interested in grow cells for vertical farming and wanted to build an automated greenhouse for myself. After my degree I even had a PHD setup on this topic! Alas i decided to venture into the big bad world. Anyway, I was hyped to built my own automated greenhouse! I dug a trench from the house to the greenhouse and laid armoured cable.</description>
