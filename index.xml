      <description>function writeImage ( path ) { var text = &#34; &#34; document.write(text) }  Oskar&amp;rsquo;s final interview! Did he get it? at the point of writing this, we still don&amp;rsquo;t know! What we did know is that Oskar had decided he was taking Jamie and I to Zurich. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure how it all came about but three boys in a hole went on tour!
We arrived in Zurich (Joe and Jamie) and found Oskar after some major confusion over how big Zurich train station was.</description>

      <description>code.has-jax { -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; background: inherit !important; border: none !important; font-size: 100%; }  The RLC circuit above can be expressed by the following equation
 $$ \ddot{I}_{L} = -\frac{\dot{I}_{L}}{RC} -\frac{I_L}{LC} + \frac{I}{LC} $$ The equation can be expressed as two first order differential equations using the following method.
$$ x_{1} = I_{L} $$
$$ x_{2} = \dot{I}_{L} $$ so $$ \dot{x}_{2} = \ddot{I}_{L} = -\frac{\dot{I}_{L}}{RC} -\frac{I_{L}}{LC} + \frac{I}{LC} $$ and $$\dot{x}_{1} =\dot{I}_{L} = x_{2}$$ Replacing variables with state variables $\bf{X}$ $$\dot{x}_{2} = - \frac{x_{2}}{RC} - \frac{x_{1}}{LC} + \frac{I}{LC}$$ Using the formula below the derivative can be discretised.</description>

      <description>SOURCE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18704913/unable-to-lock-chain-insufficient-port-permissions
If when jtagconfig is ran
1) USB-Blaster varient [2-1] unable to lock chain(Insufficient port permissions) is returned and Quartus cant program your FPGA. The following steps should fix this problem. An amazing resource on setting up Quartus and other Altera related design software is Altera Design Software 
Before a USB Blaster can be used its jtag rules and permissions must be configured.
First kill jtagd.
sudo killall -9 jtagd If jtagconfig is ran whilst jtagd is already running then jtagconfig will have no effect.</description>

      <description>Introduction The AD5627RBRMZ (Datasheet) is part of a series of 12/14/16 bit nano DACs with an I2C interface. The DAC we are interested in is the 12 bit AD5627RBRMZ which has a 5ppm/˚C internal reference and can operate upto 5V.
Design The DAC requires a high I2C level to be 0.8 * Vcc, which is 4V if we are interested in using the full capability of the DAC. In this design the I2C is operating on a 3.</description>

      <description>The ADA4096 operational amplifier comes in a dual and quad package. Its inputs are protected by overvoltage protection diodes making it a perfect candidate for monitoring voltages, especially when power to the IC could be lost.
ADA4096 Datasheet
The LTC2990 is a Quad I2C voltage, current, and temperature monitor. When used in conjunction with the ADA4096 it makes a simple monitoring interface through I2C.
LTC2990 Datasheet
The LTC2990 supply voltages are between 3.</description>

      <description>XOR gates can be used to form inverters or buffers when a single input is tied to Vdd or Ground. In the figure below, U1 is setup as an inverter, and U2 is setup as a buffer.
The SN74LVC2G86 (Datasheet) is a dual package XOR that can operate at voltages up to 5.5V and deliver up to 50mA of continuous current. Other notable features include a propagation delay between 1.4 and 4.</description>

      <description>In August 2018 my friends and I visited the Atlas mountains of Morocco and walked up Mount Toubkal. Despite my camera having a horrendous light leak I managed to get a few photos of that walk.
We had envisioned a hike though the Atlas mountains off the typical tourist route, following the Berber trails. It became apparent after the first day of ascent that we weren&amp;rsquo;t equipped for this route. I remember feeling the exposure of the desert mountains, not being able to hide from the sun and slipping down constantly.</description>

      <title>Precision Op Amp Gain Adjustment with DACs</title>

      <guid>https://furrah.github.io/op-amp-gain-adjustment-dac/</guid>
      <description>Basic non-inverting operational amplifier design involves a feedback resistor and a gain resistor. These are shown in the figure below as R2 as the feedback resistor and R1 as the gain resistor. The formula for calculating the gain is;
\begin{align} Gain = \frac{R_2}{R_1} + 1 \end{align}
It would be nice to adjust the gain of this amplifier. This can be done achieved easily with a potentiometer in place of R1 or R2.</description>

      <description>This photo was taken on a walk around Bowland forest whilst I was studying at the University of Lancaster. It must be dated around 2016 and was shot on a Rolleiflex camera with Rollei IR400 Film. Ribblehead viaduct! This was taken on a separate trip. My friend Cristina convinced me and my friend Zane that this was infact the viaduct from Harry Potter that the Hogwarts Express crossed! It is not.</description>

      <description>Reference material: Texas Instruments - Op Amp Technical Overview
When developing precision DC systems BJT transistors are the way to go. Be careful when selecting an op amp based on its datasheet noise characteristics. At DC we are interested in the 1/f noise, which as the name suggests increases as we approach DC. an example is shown below comparing the JFET input OPA827 and the BJT input OPA227.
