      <description>function writeImage ( path ) { var text = &#34; &#34; document.write(text) }  June 2020. We all went on a little summer trip to Avoriaz. Or somewhere close? Heres a picture of the &amp;lsquo;Super best friends&amp;rsquo; as Branko would say and obviously theres always one person to have their eyes closed and in this instance, it was Jamie. Maybe oskar too with his blind man glasses on.
writeImage(&#34;/photography/images/Avoriaz/DSC_1025.jpg&#34;); Very close to the cabin was a lovely little lake with a bbq area.</description>

      <description>In August 2018 my friends and I visited the Atlas mountains of Morocco and walked up Mount Toubkal. Despite my camera having a horrendous light leak I managed to get a few photos of that walk.
We had envisioned a hike though the Atlas mountains off the typical tourist route, following the Berber trails. It became apparent after the first day of ascent that we weren&amp;rsquo;t equipped for this route. I remember feeling the exposure of the desert mountains, not being able to hide from the sun and slipping down constantly.</description>

      <description>This photo was taken on a walk around Bowland forest whilst I was studying at the University of Lancaster. It must be dated around 2016 and was shot on a Rolleiflex camera with Rollei IR400 Film. 
Ribblehead viaduct! This was taken on a separate trip. My friend Cristina convinced me and my friend Zane that this was infact the viaduct from Harry Potter that the Hogwarts Express crossed! It is not.</description>
