      <description>Introduction The AD5627RBRMZ (Datasheet) is part of a series of 12/14/16 bit nano DACs with an I2C interface. The DAC we are interested in is the 12 bit AD5627RBRMZ which has a 5ppm/ËšC internal reference and can operate upto 5V.
Design The DAC requires a high I2C level to be 0.8 * Vcc, which is 4V if we are interested in using the full capability of the DAC. In this design the I2C is operating on a 3.</description>

      <description>Basic non-inverting operational amplifier design involves a feedback resistor and a gain resistor. These are shown in the figure below as R2 as the feedback resistor and R1 as the gain resistor. The formula for calculating the gain is;
\begin{align} Gain = \frac{R_2}{R_1} + 1 \end{align}
It would be nice to adjust the gain of this amplifier. This can be done achieved easily with a potentiometer in place of R1 or R2.</description>
