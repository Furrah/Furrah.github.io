      <description>Introduction The AD8627RBRMZ (Datasheet) is part of a series of 12/14/16 bit nano DACs with an I2C interface. The DAC we are interested in is the 12 bit AD8627RBRMZ which has a 5ppm/ËšC internal reference and can operate upto 5V output.
Design A typical I2C bus operates at 3.3 Volts. In order to use the full scale output of the DAC (5V) a level shifter is required as the AD8627 sees an I2C high at 0.</description>

      <title>Precision Op Amp Gain Adjustment with DACs</title>

      <description>Basic non-inverting operational amplifier design involves a feedback resistor and a gain resistor. These are shown in the figure below as R2 as the feedback resistor and R1 as the gain resistor. The formula for calculating the gain is;
\begin{align} Gain = \frac{R_2}{R_1} + 1 \end{align}
It would be nice to adjust the gain of this amplifier. This can be done achieved easily with a potentiometer in place of R1 or R2.</description>
